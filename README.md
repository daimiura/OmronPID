# 1. Source code & Contents
[Original source code](https://github.com/TripletESR/Omron_PID) can be get.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TripletESR/Omron_PID.git
```
The original souce is be abailable in Qt4 or 5.　Here, we develop applications with additional functions, mainly for safety. The source code added safety functions is available the following
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daimiura/OmronPID.git
```
The contents are 
- html
- latex
- release
- other files (*.cpp, *.h and so on)

The reference manuals for functions, etc. are generated by Doxygen (sorry for the little I have written). html, and latex directories are for the reference manuals.
The reference manual can be seen by opening
```bash
html/index.html
```
in your browser.

Omron_PID.exe, the application that controls E5CC, resides in the release directory. This directory also contains the DLL files necessary to run this .exe file.

# 2. branches
## 2.1. main
This branch is stable version.　It corresponds to Qt4 and 5 and was written in code tailored to Qt5.

## 2.2. 2023Qt6_branch
In Qt6, thisis not available because some functions are obsolute.　To use it in Qt6, this source code needs to be rewritten.　The update is developpoing in the 2023_Qt6 branch.　Now the contents in 2023_Qt6 include some issues, so  it is not available. 

# 3. Getting started
This section describes the installation of Qt, etc.　If you only use .exe, skip to the next section.
## 3.1. Qt Installation
Qt5 and 6 are available for free from [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) (as of March 2023).　You need an account, so please create one.　You can register with your e-mail address.
For example, we will create a Qt directory under the C directory and install it there.　For example, we will create a Qt directory under the C directory and install it there.
```bash
$ C/Qt/
```
ModBus communication is used with E5CC.
On the Component Selection page, install the components required for ModBus.
Qt Creator is useful for designing GUI, so Qt Creator should also be installed.　The required components are as follows (Qt 6 version is optional).
- Qt 6.5.0-rc
  - MinGW 11.2.0-64bit
  -  Qt 5 Compatibility Module
  -  Qt Shader Tools
  -  Additional Libraries
     -  Qt Serial Bus
