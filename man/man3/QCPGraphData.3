.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Holds the data of one single data point for \fBQCPGraph\fP\&. 

The stored data is: 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fIkey:\fP coordinate on the key axis of this data point (this is the \fImainKey\fP and the \fIsortKey\fP) 
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fIvalue:\fP coordinate on the value axis of this data point (this is the \fImainValue\fP)
.PP
The container for storing multiple data points is \fBQCPGraphDataContainer\fP\&. It is a typedef for \fBQCPDataContainer\fP with \fBQCPGraphData\fP as the DataType template parameter\&. See the documentation there for an explanation regarding the data type's generic methods\&.
