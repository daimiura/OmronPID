.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Base class for all drawable objects\&. 

This is the abstract base class most visible objects derive from, e\&.g\&. plottables, axes, grid etc\&.
.PP
Every layerable is on a layer (\fBQCPLayer\fP) which allows controlling the rendering order by stacking the layers accordingly\&.
.PP
For details about the layering mechanism, see the \fBQCPLayer\fP documentation\&.

.PP 
.SS "QCPLayerable::QCPLayerable (\fBQCustomPlot\fP * plot, QString targetLayer = \fCQString()\fP, \fBQCPLayerable\fP * parentLayerable = \fC0\fP)"
Creates a new \fBQCPLayerable\fP instance\&.
.PP
Since \fBQCPLayerable\fP is an abstract base class, it can't be instantiated directly\&. Use one of the derived classes\&.
.PP
If \fIplot\fP is provided, it automatically places itself on the layer named \fItargetLayer\fP\&. If \fItargetLayer\fP is an empty string, it places itself on the current layer of the plot (see \fBQCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer\fP)\&.
.PP
It is possible to provide 0 as \fIplot\fP\&. In that case, you should assign a parent plot at a later time with \fBinitializeParentPlot\fP\&.
.PP
The layerable's parent layerable is set to \fIparentLayerable\fP, if provided\&. Direct layerable parents are mainly used to control visibility in a hierarchy of layerables\&. This means a layerable is only drawn, if all its ancestor layerables are also visible\&. Note that \fIparentLayerable\fP does not become the QObject-parent (for memory management) of this layerable, \fIplot\fP does\&. It is not uncommon to set the QObject-parent to something else in the constructors of \fBQCPLayerable\fP subclasses, to guarantee a working destruction hierarchy\&.

.SS "void QCPLayerable::mouseDoubleClickEvent (QMouseEvent * event, const QVariant & details)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
This event gets called when the user presses the mouse button a second time in a double-click, while the cursor is over the layerable\&. Whether a cursor is over the layerable is decided by a preceding call to \fBselectTest\fP\&.
.PP
The \fBmouseDoubleClickEvent\fP is called instead of the second \fBmousePressEvent\fP\&. So in the case of a double-click, the event succession is \fIpressEvent -- releaseEvent -- doubleClickEvent -- releaseEvent\fP\&.
.PP
The current pixel position of the cursor on the \fBQCustomPlot\fP widget is accessible via \fCevent->pos()\fP\&. The parameter \fIdetails\fP contains layerable-specific details about the hit, which were generated in the previous call to \fBselectTest\fP\&. For example, One-dimensional plottables like \fBQCPGraph\fP or \fBQCPBars\fP convey the clicked data point in the \fIdetails\fP parameter, as \fBQCPDataSelection\fP packed as QVariant\&. Multi-part objects convey the specific \fCSelectablePart\fP that was hit (e\&.g\&. \fBQCPAxis::SelectablePart\fP in the case of axes)\&.
.PP
Similarly to \fBmousePressEvent\fP, once a layerable has accepted the \fBmouseDoubleClickEvent\fP, it is considered the mouse grabber and will receive all following calls to \fBmouseMoveEvent\fP and \fBmouseReleaseEvent\fP for this mouse interaction (a 'mouse interaction' in this context ends with the release)\&.
.PP
The default implementation does nothing except explicitly ignoring the event with \fCevent->ignore()\fP\&.

Multi-part objects convey the specific \fCSelectablePart\fP that was hit (e\&.g\&. \fBQCPAxis::SelectablePart\fP in the case of axes)\&.
.PP
\fBQCustomPlot\fP uses an event propagation system that works the same as Qt's system\&. If your layerable doesn't reimplement the \fBmousePressEvent\fP or explicitly calls \fCevent->ignore()\fP in its reimplementation, the event will be propagated to the next layerable in the stacking order\&.

Returns the parent layerable of this layerable\&. The parent layerable is used to provide visibility hierarchies in conjunction with the method \fBrealVisibility\fP\&. This way, layerables only get drawn if their parent layerables are visible, too\&.
.PP
Note that a parent layerable is not necessarily also the QObject parent for memory management\&. Further, a layerable doesn't always have a parent layerable, so this function may return 0\&.

Returns whether this layerable is visible, taking the visibility of the layerable parent and the visibility of this layerable's layer into account\&. This is the method that is consulted to decide whether a layerable shall be drawn or not\&.
.PP
If this layerable has a direct layerable parent (usually set via hierarchies implemented in subclasses, like in the case of \fBQCPLayoutElement\fP), this function returns true only if this layerable has its visibility set to true and the parent layerable's \fBrealVisibility\fP returns true\&.

.SS "double QCPLayerable::selectTest (const QPointF & pos, bool onlySelectable, QVariant * details = \fC0\fP) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function is used to decide whether a click hits a layerable object or not\&.
.PP
\fIpos\fP is a point in pixel coordinates on the \fBQCustomPlot\fP surface\&. This function returns the shortest pixel distance of this point to the object\&. If the object is either invisible or the distance couldn't be determined, -1\&.0 is returned\&. Further, if \fIonlySelectable\fP is true and the object is not selectable, -1\&.0 is returned, too\&.
.PP
If the object is represented not by single lines but by an area like a \fBQCPItemText\fP or the bars of a \fBQCPBars\fP plottable, a click inside the area should also be considered a hit\&. In these cases this function thus returns a constant value greater zero but still below the parent plot's selection tolerance\&. (typically the selectionTolerance multiplied by 0\&.99)\&.
.PP
Providing a constant value for area objects allows selecting line objects even when they are obscured by such area objects, by clicking close to the lines (i\&.e\&. closer than 0\&.99*selectionTolerance)\&.
.PP
The actual setting of the selection state is not done by this function\&. This is handled by the parent \fBQCustomPlot\fP when the mouseReleaseEvent occurs, and the finally selected object is notified via the \fBselectEvent/\fP deselectEvent methods\&.
.PP
\fIdetails\fP is an optional output parameter\&. Every layerable subclass may place any information in \fIdetails\fP\&. This information will be passed to \fBselectEvent\fP when the parent \fBQCustomPlot\fP decides on the basis of this selectTest call, that the object was successfully selected\&. The subsequent call to \fBselectEvent\fP will carry the \fIdetails\fP\&. This is useful for multi-part objects (like \fBQCPAxis\fP)\&. This way, a possibly complex calculation to decide which part was clicked is only done once in \fBselectTest\fP\&. The result (i\&.e\&. the actually clicked part) can then be placed in \fIdetails\fP\&. So in the subsequent \fBselectEvent\fP, the decision which part was selected doesn't have to be done a second time for a single selection operation\&.
.PP
You may pass 0 as \fIdetails\fP to indicate that you are not interested in those selection details\&.
