This class monitors the temperature and other parameters of the system to ensure that they remain within safe limits. If any parameter goes outside its safe range, the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_safety}{Safety}} class takes appropriate action to bring it back within range. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_the}{The}} class also provides a number of properties that can be used to configure its behavior. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
